# trile-ios

This project was first started in January 2019. At the height of the business we had ~25 Criminal Defense Attorneys using the application in North Carolina District courts and were getting excellent feedback. There was also an article written about the app in Attorney At Law magazine which you can find here: https://attorneyatlawmagazine.com/legal-innovators-trile 

This was an incredible learning experience that allowed me to see every part of the application development process:
- Gathering customer requirements
- Determining device usage statistics allowing us to target the most widely used platform (iOS in our case) for our demographic
- Wireframe/Mockup design for quick iteration following customer feedback
- Critical analysis of what tech stack could get us to MVP the quickest without sacrificing scalability
- Creation and iteration of the product with live customer feedback
- Bug fixes and support while the application was being used live in North Carolina district courtrooms

Please keep in mind this project codebase is incomplete. It took some time for me to be able to get the permission to make this code public and a few things were lost during the process such as unit tests and some functionality.
